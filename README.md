## 1. Project Overview & Goal

### Dataset & Source
This project utilises the [*IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data) sourced from Kaggle.

This synthetic dataset looks into factors that lead to employee attrition. It allows for a detailed exploration to help answer questions such as whether job satisfaction is impacted by an employees years at a company/current job/last promotion etc.

### Project's Focus

As a company with over a thousand employees our requirement for this analysis looks at the problem and a potential solution:

#### Business Problem: 
High employee turnover is costing organisations in the range of 150-200% of annual salary per departure, disrupting operations and eroding institutional knowledge. Still, organisations are reacting to resignations instead of preventing them.

#### Solution: 
Implement a dual ML system that: 
1. Uses K-means clustering to segment employees into risk regimes (Low/Moderate/High/Critical) based on patterns in the data, with optimal K determined through elbow and silhouette validation;
2. Employs binary classification to predict individual attrition probability
